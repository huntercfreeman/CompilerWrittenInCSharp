# CompilerWrittenInCSharp

This repository is my progress in learning about compilers. 

(I am surely doing a lot wrong - take all the code in this repo with a massive grain of salt)

I recommend watching Immo Landwerth's Building a Compiler youtube series ([link to youtube playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRAdsfhKI4OWNOSfS7EUu5GRAVmze1t2y)).
